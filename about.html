    <h1>About us</h1>
    <br>
    <p>To find out ways to better communicate flavour notes to consumers, I decided to speak to two experts: Dale
        Harris, 2017
        World Barista Champion and Director of Wholesale at Has Bean Coffee in Stafford, U.K., and Maxwell
        Colonna-Dashwood,
        owner of Colonna Coffee and three-time U.K. Barista Champion and World Barista Championship finalist.

        This year, Dale is running Flavour Pathways at Caffè Culture 2018, a London, UK-based trade show in its 12th
        year. It
        will run from the 16th–17th October and attendance is free for trade professionals (you can register here).

        Flavour Pathways will be an interactive sensory installation that develops concepts inspired by his
        championship-winning
        routine at the World Barista Championships 2017. One “pathway” examines how flavour is impacted by terroir,
        variety,
        roasting and processing; another explores how different factors impact our understanding of flavour, from how
        our taste
        buds work to cup shapes and more.</p>
