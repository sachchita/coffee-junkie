        One reason for this is that Robusta beans contain more caffeine. Whilst that might sound like a good thing, lots
        of
        caffeine actually makes coffee taste harsh and bitter. Arabica beans contain less caffeine and more fat-based
        compounds,
        which make coffee taste smooth and rich.just the species of coffee bean that matters though: how a bean is grown
        and harvested matters too. Even
        Arabica beans contain loads of those harsh chemicals before they ripen, so even if there’s only a few under-ripe
        beans
        in a batch (which inevitably happens when you harvest an entire crop at once with a machine) it can really ruin
        the
        taste of your final brew.
